# QR-Code-challenge
My first repository on GitHub - Creating a QR code card from Frontend Mentor
I'm new to comptuer programming and currently doing a web development bootcamp on Udemy where I have covered HTML and CSS

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Using the viewport to adjust for different screen sizes. I have not used this code before.


**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I'd like to get better at understanding how to position elements to better structure a web page. I've seen some solutions using flex which i'm not familiar with. I don't think i've positioned the QR Card correctly on the page and will look to better understand positioning.


### Useful resources

I usually refer to MDN (wwww.developer.mozilla.org) and W3Schools (www.w3schools.com) to check CSS style options and syntax.
